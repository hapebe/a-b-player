==========

An A-B Repeat/Loop Audio Player with HTML5, based on 
https://github.com/holin/abRepeater, largely extended 
for the practice / sing-along tracks of "The Melodetts"

=======
trying to switch to WaveSurfer.js 
(https://wavesurfer-js.org/) as the actual player 
element.

TODOs:
* add current time indicator
* add volume adjustment slider
* add graphic representation of loop(s) - wavesurfer.js region plugin...
