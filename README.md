a-b-player
==========

An A-B Repeat/Loop Audio Player with HTML5, based on 
https://github.com/holin/abRepeater, largely extended 
for the practice / sing-along tracks of "The Melodetts" 
by hapebe@gmx.de

2017-10 
=======
trying to switch to WaveSurfer.js (https://wavesurfer-js.org/) as the actual player element.

2017-11
=======
* added custom favicon(s), also for Android and iOS shortcuts
* added current time indicator (playback position)
* made the track list full width and allowed 4 columns for the overview on XL screens


TODOs:
* add volume adjustment slider
* add graphic representation of loop(s) - wavesurfer.js region plugin...
* if the number of tracks is >50 / > 100 (?), prefix the list of tracks for each initial letter with this letter.
